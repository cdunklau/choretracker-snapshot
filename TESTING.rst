Setup
=====

1. Start by installing `pipenv <https://docs.pipenv.org/>`_, then install the
   project with dev deps::

        pipenv install --dev

.. note::

    The selenium stuff is just a placeholder for now, nothing is implemented
    properly yet.

2. Install Firefox and the Firefox driver for Selenium. On a Mac with homebrew,
   just run::

        brew install geckodriver
